# Maruti 800 Electric Conversion Project

## Project Overview
This project involves converting a Maruti 800 into an electric vehicle (EV) as part of a final year project in the Mechanical Engineering department at Saveetha Engineering College. The project aims to replace the internal combustion engine with an electric motor and lead-acid battery packs, allowing the car to run solely on electric power.

## Project Details

- **Vehicle:** Maruti 800
- **Weight:** 1500 kg (including passengers)
- **Maximum Speed:** 25 km/h
- **Range:** 50 km
- **Motor:** 2 kW BLDC motor
- **Batteries:** 5 lead-acid battery packs, each 20 kWh
- **Incline Angle:** 0 degrees

## Role and Responsibilities

As part of a team of 50 students, my specific roles included:

- **Motor Selection:** Calculated that a 2 kW motor was required to meet the power demands of the car, considering the total weight of 1500 kg and a target speed of 25 km/h.
- **Transmission System:** Selected and integrated a suitable transmission system to work efficiently with the chosen BLDC motor.
- **Battery Placement:** Assisted in determining the placement of the battery packs, ensuring an optimal distribution of weight to maintain vehicle balance.

## Calculations

### Power Calculation

To ensure the car operates within the desired speed range using a 2 kW motor, we performed the following calculations:

- **Total Weight (m):** 1500 kg
- **Desired Speed (v):** 25 km/h (6.94 m/s)
- **Incline Angle (θ):** 0° (Flat surface)

**Rolling Resistance (F_rr):**
\[ F_{rr} = C_{rr} \times m \times g \]
Where:
- \( C_{rr} = 0.01 \) (rolling resistance coefficient)
- \( g = 9.81 \) m/s² (gravity)

\[ F_{rr} = 0.01 \times 1500 \times 9.81 = 147.15 \text{ N} \]

**Aerodynamic Resistance (F_ar):**
\[ F_{ar} = \frac{1}{2} \times C_d \times A \times \rho \times v^2 \]
Where:
- \( C_d = 0.3 \) (drag coefficient)
- \( A = 2.2 \) m² (frontal area)
- \( \rho = 1.225 \) kg/m³ (air density)
- \( v = 6.94 \) m/s

\[ F_{ar} = 0.5 \times 0.3 \times 2.2 \times 1.225 \times (6.94)^2 = 25.1 \text{ N} \]

**Total Resistance (F_total):**
\[ F_{total} = F_{rr} + F_{ar} \]
\[ F_{total} = 147.15 + 25.1 = 172.25 \text{ N} \]

**Power Required (P):**
\[ P = F_{total} \times v \]
\[ P = 172.25 \times 6.94 = 1195.41 \text{ W} \text{ or 1.2 kW} \]
